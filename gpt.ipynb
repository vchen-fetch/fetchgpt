      "As of May 2025, Costco's most popular item remains its Kirkland Signature Bath Tissue. The warehouse retailer sells over a billion rolls annually, generating nearly $500 million in revenue. This popularity is attributed to its affordability—approximately $23 for 30 rolls—and quality, being thicker and more absorbent than many other brands.
